Advanced CSS Features
This project demonstrates advanced CSS features through a series of tasks. Each task focuses on a specific CSS property and its effects.

Tasks
Task 1: Box Shadow
Change the box-shadow values to see how different offsets and colors affect the shadow.

Example:

box-shadow: 5px 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
Task 2: Text Shadow
Modify the text-shadow values to see how different offsets and colors affect the text shadow.

Example:

text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
Task 3: Background Size
Change the background-size property to different values like contain, 50% 50%, 100% 100%, etc., and observe how the background image scales.

Example:

background-size: contain;
Task 4: Additional Challenges
Add more elements and apply different combinations of box-shadow, text-shadow, and background-size. Create a button with a hover effect that changes the box-shadow and background-size.
